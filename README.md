# 📊 Logistic Regression and Softmax Cost

## 🔍 Overview
This project explores **Logistic Regression** and the **Softmax Cost Function**, fundamental concepts in machine learning classification. It provides a theoretical understanding along with Python implementations.

## 📌 Key Concepts
- **Logistic Regression**: A binary classification algorithm.
- **Softmax Function**: Extends logistic regression to multiple classes.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Measures classification performance.
- **Equivalence of Softmax and Cross-Entropy**.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **6_3_Logistic_Regression_and_Softmax_Cost.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook with theory and code.
- **datasets/** → Sample data used for classification.
- **images/** → Plots and visualizations.
